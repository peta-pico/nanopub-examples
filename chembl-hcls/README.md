ChEMBL HCLI Dataset Descriptions as Nanopublications
====================================================

These are examples of nanopublications extracted from the
[HCLI specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/#appendix_1).

The nanopublication [/chembl-hcls-summary.trig] introduces the dataset at the
summary level, by establishing the following three types of identifiers:

- It introduces the identifier of the dataset at the summary level:
  `http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/`
- It introduces the public key of the entity authorized to announce new versions
  and metadata updates: `MIIBtzCCASwGByqGSM44...`
- And it establishes an immutable identifier for this introduction of
  identifiers and the associated metadata (which is also the nanopublication
  identifier): `http://purl.org/np/RAq20KleadvIv-ssT5lXwdEUbpCy_yYDysucuQFSnEqpI`
